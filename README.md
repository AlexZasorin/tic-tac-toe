Tic-Tac-Toe
============
Work in progress Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java using Swing UI with multiple difficulty levels and support for arbitrary board size. Uses minimax algorithm for AI player. The goal of this project is to experiment with the minimax algorithm and heuristics. Eventually, I would like to expand this to play Checkers, Chess, and potentially others.
